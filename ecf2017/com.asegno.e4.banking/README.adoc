== Project Contents

This project contains the initial data model and persistence tests for the demo.

== Launch the Derby DataBase

To launch the Derby database, download the latest version from the apache website http://db.apache.org/derby/.
Choose the bin distribution, and extract the zip on your computer. 

Then, make the Derby tools available in your path:

* set the DERBY_HOME environment variable
* Add DERBY_HOME/bin to the PATH environment variable.

Finally, start the network server database using the command `startNetworkServer`. 
By default, the database starts *localhost:1527*. 
In this case, the connection string is *jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/<DB_NAME>*
